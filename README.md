# Trader Joe's DB


###A User-Powered Trader Joe's DB###

I'm currently working part-time at Trader Joe's and there's an inside joke that I became familiar with very early on. The joke goes something like this: if a customer asks about their favorite product, it's probably discontinued. This project seeks to address this lack of up to date product info by empowering the customer so that they can keep track of their favorite products for themselves.

Currently, the app displays only dummy data, but my vision for it is a completely user-powered database where TJ's enthusiasts can add new products and update the status of existing products.
